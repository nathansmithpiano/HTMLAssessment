# HTML Assessment Project

### Description
This basic HTML project explores core HTML elements and tags.  It includes roughly one half day of learning in HTML.  The requirements do not include any styling or other things outside of basic HTML.

### Technologies Used
- Macbook 2015 Pro Retina
- Atom
- Git / Github
- Google Chrome

### What was fun? Areas for future improvement?
- I am looking forward to seeing how we bring our Java skills into play with other languages.  Prior to this bootcamp, I have worked in HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL, and a very tiny bit in Javascript.
